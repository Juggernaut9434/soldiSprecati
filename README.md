## Game Setup

Scene Builder creates an fxml file,
then the Controller takes attributes from that fxml
and the Application is attached to the Controller
while the fxml file is attached to the Application.

Basically, everything is nicely sewn together.

There is the JavaFX and the terminal version, 
the terminal version does not have betting functionality as of v1.0.0.0

## How to Play

The player wants to have a higher score than the dealer. 
The catch is that the player cannot go above the score of 21.
The number is the number you get added to the score; face cards are worth 10.
The ace can either be a score of 1 or 11, you're choice.
There is no limit to the amount of cards you can have, just stay at or below 21, 
or else you lose.

- Click the hit btn to add a card to your hand
- Click stay to stop adding cards to your hand
- in the top left, you can change you're bet amount
